# Trivia

## Context
This is a front-end project that involves the development of a classic trivia game. The application consists of five multiple-choice questions and is built using modern technologies such as React, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Redux for state management. The aim of the game is to answer all five questions correctly and earn points, which are then tallied and displayed in a final scoreboard. With Redux, the application's state management is more organized, making the code more efficient and maintainable. During gameplay, users must select the appropriate answer from the choices given and submit their response.
